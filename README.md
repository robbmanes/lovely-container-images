# lovely-container-images
A collection of applications I've containerized or written to be executed in a container, usually for testing purposes (or my own use).

## Container Images
- [iopl-test](images/iopl-test) - runs `iopl` within a container, useful for verifying container permissions.
- [segfaulter](images/segfaulter) - intentionally causes a segfault, useful for testing coredump collection.
